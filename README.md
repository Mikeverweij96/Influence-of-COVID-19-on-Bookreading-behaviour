# Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Book Consumption
This repository contains the workflow of my master thesis [The Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Book Consumption](https://github.com/Mikeverweij96/Influence-of-COVID-19-on-Bookreading-behaviour/blob/48ec56e474920f0f5635807bd9ae9926960f8fc2/Verweij%20(2022).pdf). Specificically, this repository contains the workflow for data preperation and analysis used for my thesis. 

In my thesis, I have investigated how COVID-19 restrictions have affected the amount people read, consumersâ€™ reading speed, evaluation of books and types of books read and how these effects vary across age groups, genders, types of readers and nationalities. The expected relationships that have been investigated are shown below:
